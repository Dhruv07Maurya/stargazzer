    { term: 'Orbit', definition: 'The curved path an object takes around a star, planet, or moon due to gravity. Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days.' },
    { term: 'Satellite', definition: 'Any object that orbits another object. The Moon is a natural satellite; GPS satellites are artificial ones we launched.' },
    { term: 'Solar Flare', definition: 'A sudden burst of energy from the Sun\'s surface. Like a giant explosion that can affect radio signals and power grids on Earth.' },
    { term: 'Geomagnetic Storm', definition: 'When particles from the Sun disturb Earth\'s magnetic field. Can cause beautiful auroras but also disrupt GPS and power systems.' },
    { term: 'Aurora', definition: 'Colorful lights in the sky near the poles (Northern/Southern Lights) caused by solar particles hitting Earth\'s atmosphere.' },
    { term: 'Meteor', definition: 'A piece of space rock that burns up as it enters Earth\'s atmosphere, creating a streak of light — a "shooting star."' },
    { term: 'Meteor Shower', definition: 'When Earth passes through a trail of debris left by a comet, causing many meteors in a short time.' },
    { term: 'Asteroid', definition: 'A rocky object orbiting the Sun, mostly found between Mars and Jupiter. Smaller than a planet.' },
    { term: 'Comet', definition: 'An icy body that develops a glowing tail when it gets close to the Sun, as ice turns to gas.' },
    { term: 'Eclipse', definition: 'When one celestial body blocks light to another. Solar eclipse: Moon blocks Sun. Lunar eclipse: Earth\'s shadow covers Moon.' },
    { term: 'Light Year', definition: 'The distance light travels in one year — about 9.46 trillion kilometers. Used to measure vast cosmic distances.' },
    { term: 'ISS', definition: 'International Space Station — a habitable spacecraft orbiting Earth at ~400 km altitude, home to astronauts from many countries.' },
    { term: 'Kp Index', definition: 'A scale (0-9) measuring geomagnetic activity. Higher values mean stronger storms and better chances of seeing auroras.' },
    { term: 'Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)', definition: 'A massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields released from the Sun. Can trigger geomagnetic storms when it hits Earth.' },
    { term: 'Zenith', definition: 'The point directly above you in the sky. If you look straight up, that\'s the zenith.' },
    { term: 'Exoplanet', definition: 'A planet that orbits a star outside our solar system. Thousands have been discovered since the 1990s.' },
    { term: 'NDVI', definition: 'Normalized Difference Vegetation Index — satellites measure this to check plant health from space. Green = healthy, brown = stressed.' },
    { term: 'Remote Sensing', definition: 'Collecting information about Earth from a distance, usually using satellites. Used for weather, farming, and disaster tracking.' },
    { term: 'Payload', definition: 'The cargo carried by a rocket into space — could be a satellite, science experiment, or supplies.' },
    { term: 'Geostationary Orbit', definition: 'An orbit ~36,000 km above Earth where a satellite moves at Earth\'s rotation speed, appearing to stay in one spot. Used for TV and weather satellites.' },
